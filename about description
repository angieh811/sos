SOS is a online program designed to help autistic children gain communication skills they are lacking. 
Current approaches to this are cumbersome and expensive, as the exercises require physical materials and interaction. 
The students requiring help developing these skills are pulled out of class, taking away from their educational and social development
and leading to moments of embarressment that can hinder their efforts to reach out in the future.

However, many of these activities can be digitalized to provide not only a cheaper alternative, 
but a way the students with a way to access and continue to strengthen their communication skills when out of school.
This provides them with more instructional time, and more time to put to use the skills they are trying to develop.
